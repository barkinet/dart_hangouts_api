# dart_hangouts_api

### STILL NEEDS LOTS OF TESTING, USE WITH CARE!

### Description

Wraps all the Google+ Hangout API calls to make it easy to write Hangout Apps in Dart with all the js-interop happening in the background in the library.

Official API documentation: https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/


### Usage

Create a new Web application in Dart Editor and delete the .html;

Add this dependency to your pubspec.yaml

```
  dependencies:
    dart_hangouts_api:
      git: git://github.com/Scarygami/dart_hangouts_api.git
```

Create a Gadget xml file similar to this to include your HTML.

```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <Module>
    <ModulePrefs title="Dart Hangout Test">
      <Require feature="rpc"/>
      <Require feature="views"/>
      <Require feature="locked-domain"/>
    </ModulePrefs>
    <Content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Dart_hangout_test</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="<YOUR_SERVER_PATH>/dart_hangout_test.css">
      <script src="//talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/_/api/hangout.js?v=1.3"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Dart-Hangout-Test</h1>
      <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
      <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
      <button id="button3">Button 3</button>
      <button id="button4">Button 4</button>
      <button id="button5">Button 5</button>
      <div id="container">
        <p id="text"></p>
      </div>
      <script type="application/dart" src="<YOUR_SERVER_PATH>/dart_hangout_test/dart_hangout_test.dart"></script>
      <script src="<YOUR_SERVER_PATH>/dart_hangout_test/packages/browser/dart.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
      ]]>
    </Content>
  </Module>
```

Make sure to use a full server path for `<YOUR_SERVER_PATH>` which has to be a publicly available.

In your Dart application import the Hangout API Library:

```
import "package:hangouts_api/hangouts_api.dart";
```

Then you can initialize it and wait for the onAPIReady event:

```
  hapi = new Hangout();
  hapi.onApiReady.add((ApiReadyEvent event) {
    if (event.isApiReady) {
      // you can start using the API now
    }
  });
```

You can then use all of the API calls as documented at https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/api/


### Testing

To test your application you will first have to upload it (including the packages) to `<YOUR_SERVER_PATH>`

Then go to [google apis console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and create a new Project
Create a new `Client ID` for web applications in "API Access"
Activate the Google+ Hangouts API in "Services"

In "Hangouts" enter the URL to your XML file in Application URL.

At the bottom of that page you can then "Save" and "Enter a hangout".

(Of course this will only work in Dartium without compiling to js...)
